        body: ` <h3>What is acne?</h3>
      <p>Acne  is a skin condition commonly known as pimples. It is the inflammation of sebaceous gland (oil glands) and characterized by whiteheads, blackheads, and red, inflamed patches of skin. </p>
      <h3>What causes acne?</h3>
      <p>Acne is not caused by just one factor. Acne happens when oil glands attached to the hair follicles are activated at the time of puberty. It is associated with increased oil production and clogging of follicular openings or pores. The clogged follicle enlarges, producing a bump.</p>
      <h3>What are the symptoms?</h3>
      <p>The parts of the skin that have high number of functional oil glands are more prone to acne. These include face, neck, upper chest, back and shoulders. Various signs and symptoms are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Blackheads or white heads</strong>- These are black or white raised lesions on skin surface, seen due to blockage of skin pores. They usually heal without scarring.</li>
        <li><strong>Papules</strong> - They are the most common lesions. Generally, the first that people get are raised bumpy papules. They can be red and painful, which are signs of infection.</li>
        <li><strong>Pus filled lesion (pustule)</strong> - These are inflammatory lesions and there is formation of pus due to widespread infection. They sometimes become huge and heals with scarring.</li>
        <li><strong>Deep acne (nodules) and cysts </strong> - This is the most severe form. In this type, the acne becomes a painful lump beneath the skin surface and is filled with pus. They are very tender and may burst with pus discharge. They always heal with scarring. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Who are more prone to get acne?</h3>
      <p>Few patients may develop acne due to problems like mental & physical stress, over usage of cosmetics, irregular periods, hormonal imbalance, excessive intake of oily and junk food which are likely to aggravate acne.</p>
      <h3>How they can be prevented?</h3>
      <p> <strong>They can be prevented by taking various precautions:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clean your skin gently with a mild soap removing all dirt or make-up. Wash your face twice a day. </li>
        <li>Avoid too much of scrubbing or frequent skin washing.</li>
        <li>Avoid very greasy cosmetics or creams. Take off make-up properly before sleeping.</li>
        <li>If you have an oily scalp, shampoo your hair thrice a week and avoid putting oil.</li>
        <li>Avoid frequent touching your face with your hands or fingers as it causes infection.</li>
        <li>Never squeeze, scratch, pick, or rub the pimples as it can lead to scarring.</li>
        <li>Never do self-medication. Always consult dermatologist in Delhi and ask for different treatment options available.</li>

      <h3>What is Psoriasis?</h3>
      <p>Psoriasis is a chronic, non-contagious, skin condition in which there is disturbance in the skin growing cell cycle and immune cells. Usually the skin cells grow gradually and old skin sheds in about every 4 weeks. As this occurs, the new skin cells come to replace as the old one fall. But in psoriasis, the skin cells grow too quickly and shed very frequently, in days rather than weeks, forming thick, white or red patches on skin. This gives the appearance of the thick skin patches, or "plaques." Plaques range in size, and most often appear on the knees, elbows, scalp, hands, feet, and lower back. </p>
      <h3>What causes psoriasis?</h3>
      <p>The exact cause of psoriasis is unknown, but most dermatologists believe that it occurs when there is a defect in immune system and skin development cycle, causing inflammation and flaking.</p>
      <h3>Who are more prone to develop psoriasis?</h3>
      <p>Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease and can affect anyone. However, people who are more prone are:</p>
      <div class="left48">

<li> Take treatment from a dermatologist in the initial stage itself.</li>

        body: `<h3>What is eczema?</h3>
      <p>Eczema refers to the inflammation or irritation of the outer layer of the skin (epidermis). It causes skin dryness or recurring skin rashes. It is a way of skinâ€™s reaction to a source of allergy or infection.</p>
      <h3>What are the symptoms?</h3>
      <p>Symptoms may range from redness, swelling, itching, crusting, cracks to the bleeding of the skin. Eczema is non-contagious and particularly common among housewives and young children.</p>
      <h3>What area the Causes?</h3>
      <p>Though the exact cause of eczema is unknown, it is linked to an overactive response in the body's immune system to certain triggers. People with a history of other allergies or asthma are more prone to develop eczema.</p>
      <h3>How it can be prevented?</h3>
      <p>While eczema itself cannot be prevented, outbreaks can usually be avoided or the severity reduced by practicing simple guidelines. Patients are advised to abide by the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Moisturize skin frequently and avoid harsh soaps or detergents.</li>
        <li>Avoid contact with water for longer period</li>
        <li>Avoid environmental triggers such as dust.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Eczema Treatment at skin n laser centre in Delhi</h3>
      <p>Though there is no permanent cure for eczema, but proper treatment from dermatologist generally controls the disease. <strong><em>Treatment for eczema</em></strong> aims to relieve and prevent itching, which can lead to infection. Because dry skin often makes skin itchy, applying moisturizer after bathing when skin is damp is recommended. Other treatment options include:</p>
      <p><strong>Medication:</strong> For mild <em>eczema</em> creams and ointments are often prescribed to reduce inflammation. When the affected area becomes infected, antibiotics may be necessary to kill the infection-causing bacteria. For severe cases, oral medication is necessary to reduce the symptoms and spread of the disease.</p>

      <p>The <a href="acupulse+fractional+co2+laser+treatment+in+delhi+dermatologist+in+delhi.html" title="fractional CO2 laser">fractional CO2 laser</a> takes the CO2 laser beam and fractionates, or pixellates that beam into thousands of tiny little shafts of light. These tiny shafts of light penetrate into the deeper layers of the skin. The skin then repairs those tiny shafts by pushing out the old sun damaged skin and replacing it with new skin. The "collateral" heat damage also helps to shrink existing collagen. - See more at: <a href="https://www.drsandeshgupta.com/acupulse+fractional+co2+laser+treatment+in+delhi+dermatologist+in+delhi.html">Click here</a></p>`

        body: `<h2>What Is Hirsutism?</h2>
      <p> <span class='st_facebook_hcount' displayText='Facebook'></span> <span class='st_googleplus_hcount' displayText='Google +'></span> <span class='st_twitter_hcount' displayText='Tweet'></span> <span class='st_fblike_hcount' displayText='Facebook Like'></span> <span class='st_pinterest_hcount' displayText='Pinterest'></span> </p>
      <p>Hirsutism is the appearance of dark coarse unwanted hair specially in females on the areas like face, chin, cheek, upper lips, forehead, neck or chest. Some of these hair is very light in colour and not noticeable. But the dark hard hair specially on face are embarrassing and need to be managed effectively.</p>
      <h3>What are the symptoms of this condition?</h3>
      <p>All women have some soft hair on their forehead, face or upper lip. They are light in colour and not really visible but when facial hair becomes hard and excessive especially on chin, in front of neck and above the lips women seek effective and permanent treatment.</p>
      <h3>What causes facial hair?</h3>
      <p>The tendency to get excessive facial hair or hirsutism is due to abnormal production of male hormones (androgens) in women. Excess amount of this hormone activates the hair follicle thereby increasing the hair growth. Due to the abnormal production of androgen the hair which grows are of male pattern (moustache, beard). This is more common in females with hormonal imbalance, pregnancy, taking birth control pills or any steroids, weight gain, menopause or poly cystic ovarian syndrome (a medical condition can cause unwanted facial hair especially if the woman is also obese).</p>
      <h3>Hirsutism Treatment at skin n laser centre in Delhi</h3>
      <p>Although Plucking, tweezing, threading, waxing or bleaching are commonly used to get rid of these unwanted hair but these ways are not very promising to remove them permanently. They have their own side effects and need to be repeated on a regular basis as hair grows back within 15-20 days. Furthermore, they may be effective for women with minor hair growth, the ones with severe form of this problem would need the treatment from expert for long term benefit. </p>
      <p>At <em>Skin n laser centre</em> we have the most advanced Light Sheer Diode Laser from <strong>Lumenis U.S.A., a Gold standard laser for hair removal</strong>.</p>
      <h3>How does diode laser work?</h3>
      <p>A laser produces a beam of highly concentrated light. The light emitted is well absorbed by the pigment located in hair follicles. The laser pulses for a fraction of a second, just long enough to vaporize the pigment, disabling numerous follicles at a time to eliminate or significantly impede the hair growth. Treatment from this laser gives very effective results from the first sitting itself.  <strong>For more information from the experts, <a href="dermatologist+in+delhi+skin+specialist+in+delhi+east+delhi+shahdara+laxmi+nagar+seelampur+krishna+nagar+preet+vihar.html" title="book an appointment">book an appointment</a> at Skin N Laser centre East Delhi</strong>.</p>
