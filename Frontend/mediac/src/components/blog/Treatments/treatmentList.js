This Resurfacing laser removes layers of skin in a fractionated method (columns of skin are removed, leaving the skin surrounding each column intact to aid in healing). This laser excels at treating deeper wrinkles, more severe textural changes from sun damage, wrinkles, blotchiness, acne scars, and surgical or traumatic scars. </p>
      <div class="clearfix"></div>
      <h3>How does CO2 skin causes resurface of skin?</h3>
      <p>This laser is designed to offer the versatility of treating both superficial and deep scars along with skin resurfacing. The wavelength of light emitted by a CO2 laser is very well absorbed by water in the skin. "Ultra-pulses" of the laser vaporizes lines, wrinkles, scars, dark spots and other irregularities, layer by layer. This process also stimulates the formation of new collagen, thereby providing better elasticity and support to the skin.</p>
      <h3>How does the fractional CO2 laser work?<img src="https://www.drsandeshgupta.com/images/skin-resurfacing.jpg" width="240" style="border:0; padding-top:13px; padding-right:30px; " alt="Acupulse Fractional Co2 Laser" title="Acupulse Fractional Co2 Laser"/></h3>
      <p>The fractional CO2 laser takes the CO2 laser beam and fractionates or pixelates that beam into thousands of tiny little shafts of light. These tiny shafts of light penetrate into the deeper layers of the skin. The skin then repairs those tiny shafts by pushing out the old sun damaged skin and replacing it with new skin. The "collateral" heat damage also helps to shrink existing collagen.</p>
      <h3>What are the indications of Fractional Co2 Laser?</h3>
      <div class="left35">

            ` <h3>How are fractional CO2 laser treatments performed?</h3>
      <p>The area to be treated is cleansed first and then a numbing cream is applied. After you numb for about an hour, parameters are set in the machines according to the skin type and nature of the lesion and laser beam is given in a uniform pattern. The treatment takes about 5 minutes for a full face and feels like "pins and needles" sensation which is tolerable. Ice or cooling gel pack is applied on the area before, during and after the treatment, to make it comfortable.</p>
      <h3>What benefits can I expect?</h3>
      <p>Results are very encouraging. There would be a noticeable reduction in scars and open pores from the first sitting itself. Other components of sun damaged skin will also be benefited such as age-spots, fine lines, wrinkles, uneven coloration, skin laxity, textural irregularities. The skin will continue to improve for a period of 6 months following the procedure, provided proper skincare is used and sun exposure is minimized.</p>
      <h3>When will I see results?</h3>
      <p>Bear in mind that the fractional CO2 laser can be customized. Treatments can be deeper, with more healing and downtime, or shallower, with less healing time. Generally, the deeper the treatment, the better the results.</p>
      <p>You will see some immediate results. Lightening of the scars would be noticed after first session only but full results may take 3-6 months. After your skin heals, which may take up to 3-14 days, there will be a period of 4 to 6 weeks, when your skin might be slightly pink. During this period, your skin will feel smoother and looks less blotchy. As the colour returns to normal, you will see fewer lines, less blotchiness, and more glow. </p>
      <h3>How many treatments will I need?</h3>
      <p>The number depends on the extent of sun damage, depth of the scars or wrinkles and conditions to be treated. Generally, 8-10 sessions are recommended to get the desired results.</p>
      <h3>What are the risks and side effects?</h3>
      <p>Depending on the area and the aggressiveness of the treatment, it will take 5-7days for the skin to heal. This downtime will include mild redness, dryness, flaking or pigmentation. It is important to follow the instructions given by your dermatologist along with sun protection to prevent complications. Since, we at the skin n laser centre use the best quality laser i.e. <strong>Acupulse fractional co2 laser</strong> from Lumenis USA, so the downtime and chances of the side effects are minimal.</p>
      <h3>How long do the effects of fractional CO2 laser resurface last?</h3>
      <p>That depends on how well you protect your skin from the sun and other factors that cause ageing like your general health, smoking, changes in weight, etc. If you do proper sun protection you can maintain the good effects of your <em>CO2 laser treatment</em> for several years. With this treatment you will definitely 'turn the age clock back'</p>

      <p>A laser produces a beam of highly concentrated light. The light emitted is well absorbed by the pigment located in hair follicles. The laser pulses for a fraction of a second, just long enough to vaporize the pigment, disabling numerous follicles at a time to eliminate or significantly impede the hair growth. <strong>Skin n laser centre</strong>, uses the highest technology from Lumenis U.S.A., a Gold standard Light Sheer Diode laser with incomparable treatment efficacies in <em>hair removal</em>.</p>

During the treatment, there will be a tingling or stinging sensation, which can be tolerated. But, if you want the process to be completely painless, topical aesthetic creams are also available.</p>
      <h3>How many sessions do I need?</h3>
      <p>Number of sessions varies depending on patient's hair thickness, density and area to be treated. Eight to ten sessions are generally recommended, but few cases with patchy growth or fine hair even after ten sessions, may require treatment for longer period for maintenance.</p>
      <h3>Does it work on Gary hair?</h3>
      <p>Laser energy is attracted to the melanin in our hair. The greater the amount of melanin, the better the results. White or gravy hair does not contain any melanin and, therefore, does not respond to treatments.</p>
      <h3>Do I need to grow the hair for the treatment?</h3>
      <p>No, in fact we ask you to shave the area you want to be treated. Laser actually targets the anatomical structures below the skin. Surface hair actually interferes with the process.</p>
      <p>
`, `<h3>How soon will I see the results?</h3>
      <p>You may see some changes immediately. Duration of one or two weeks will be taken for all of the hair in the treated area to fall. After that, you will experience no growth for several weeks. Therefore, you will be receiving immediate gratification, while you are moving towards a long-term goal.</p>
      <h3>Can I take treatment while I am on other medications?</h3>
      <p>The only medications that are prohibited for  <a href="https://www.drsandeshgupta.com/blog/undertaking-laser-hair-removal-for-clean-looks-by-best-dermatologist-in-east-delhi/" title="Laser Hair Removal Treatment In Delhi">laser hair removal</a> are Isotretinoin and Retinol-A, which must be discontinued prior to treatment.</p>

It is a fairly simple, easy, painless, non-invasive, skin rejuvenation procedure using a combination of a fine abrasive tip or crystals along with vacuum suction applied to the skin. The pressure and speed are adjusted depending on the sensitivity and tolerance of the skin.</p>
      <p><strong>The advantages of this procedure are-</strong></p>
      <ul>
<li> It is completely painless, hence no needles or anesthesia required.</li>
<li> No down time and person can immediately return to daily activity.</li>
<li> Makeup and non-irritating creams can usually be applied within a few hours or right after microdermabrasion.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Since there is an increase in minor skin sensitivity after the procedure, irritating products like glycolic acids or scented creams or lotions are usually avoided right after it.</p>

In first type we use Aluminium oxide powder to rub your skin and in second type a diamond-tip wand is used to slough off the top layer (epidermis) of your skin and stimulate new skin growth.</p>
      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p>This procedure helps in two ways, first to remove dead layer of the skin and gives you a fresh look. Second, repeated microdermabrasion helps in collagen regeneration; a protein which provides the bulk and health to your skin. Collagen is abundant when we are young and reduces with aging resulting in looser, uneven and wrinkled skin. Microdermabrasion causes thickening of collagen which gives you a young look.</p>
      <p>This procedure is very simple and hardly takes five minutes.The sessions are given at two weeks’ interval and usually six to eight sittings are needed for desired results.</p>
      <h3>What will be the effects?</h3>
      <p>It improves skin complexion and texture. Removes dullness and roughness of the skin and gives you a healthy, glowing and tight skin.</p>

        <li><strong>Superficial peels</strong> are the mildest type and can be used for all skin types.Egg. glycolic acid.</li>

      </ul>
      <h3>How a peel is done?</h3>
      <p>Right before the peel, the skin is cleaned. The chemical (usually a liquid or paste) is then applied to the skin with a small brush, gauze, or cotton-tip applicator and left for few minutes (depending on the condition and type of peel used). Water or alcohol may be used to neutralize it and then it is wiped off. You may feel a little burning during the treatment and mild redness may be there just after the procedure. Dead skin may peel for next two to three days so that new fresh skin can replace. You don't have to be worry about any of these temporary symptoms and just take proper care of your skin which involves:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cleansing and moisturizing the skin daily.</li>
        <li>Sun protection is a must by using a proper sunscreen as recommended by the doctor since the new skin is more susceptible to sun damage.</li>

      <p>The derma roller is a micro needling technique which is used to break down the old scar tissue and stimulate formation of new collagen and blood vessels.</p>
      <h3>How is the treatment performed?</h3>
      <p>The area to be treated is cleaned first and then topical aesthetic cream may be applied to numb the skin which makes the procedure relatively painless. After this, derma roller is rolled over the affected area till a uniform redness is visible. The dermatologist can also suggest addition of some agents with Derma roller like platelet rich plasma to improve its efficacy and obtain better results.</p>
      <h3>How often the Derma roller treatment can be repeated?</h3>
      <p>Derma roller treatment is usually recommended for hair therapy, scars and facial rejuvenation and needs to be done at an interval of 15 days to get the desired results.</p>
      <h3>How does the derma roller help in acne scars?</h3>
      <p>The Derma roller causes a controlled micro injury to the skin, which in turn stimulates the formation of new collagen and new blood vessels into the treated area thereby improves the appearance and texture of the scars. It is also effective for reducing pigmentation and helps in skin rejuvenation.</p>
      <h3>How does the derma roller help in controlling the hair loss?</h3>
      <p>The scalp is a thick tissue, and most of the hair stimulating molecules need to be delivered to the hair follicles base which is about 0.5 mm deep. The Derma roller helps in delivering these molecules by creating microchannel through which it can directly reach their point of action. This treatment also increases the blood circulation in the scalp which brings more nutrition to the hair roots.</p>
      <h2>Monotherapy (stem cell based)</h2>
      <p>Stem cells are the cells which have the ability to divide in culture and give rise to specialized cells. Stem cells can be developed into many types of new cells. When we put stem cells in body, these cells divide to generate new cells such as skin and hair cells or can repair the damaged tissue.</p>
      <p>Stem cell supplements bring essential anti-ageing, health & beauty benefits by providing necessary elements to the body to improve cellular regeneration, organ rejuvenation and tissue healing.</p>

      <h2>Fillers</h2>
      <p>Dermal fillers are non-surgical cosmetic treatment which brings a more youthful appearance by restoring volume or fullness to the face and lips. Dermal Fillers contain a purified form of Hyaluronic acid, a natural component of our skin which we loose with ageing. Fillers have been called "liquid face lifts" because they offer benefits of a surgical facelift with no downtime. They fill and increase the volume of the cheeks, chin and lips which is usually lost with ageing. Areas that can be treated include the laughter folds, the glabella lines (deep frown), smoker’s lines (area above the upper lip), lip volume, shape and size (body of lips, lip line, philtrum, cupids bow), reshape nose and jawline and to correct under eye hollowness.</p>

        body: [` <h3>Narrowband UVB Light Therapy (NB-UVB)</h3>
      <p><img class="imgright" title="Vitiligo Treatments, Vitiligo Treatments In Delhi" alt="Vitiligo Treatments, Vitiligo Treatments In Delhi" style="border:0;" src="https://www.drsandeshgupta.com/images/vitiligo-treatments.jpg">A narrowband UVB lamp emits light in a therapeutic range.</p>
      <p>Narrowband UVB lights (NB-UVB) comprise a subset of the UVB spectrum which is centred at roughly 311 nm. This is less than 1% of the total range of wavelengths from sunlight.</p>

      <p>Studies have shown that narrow band UVB light treatment uses the optimal part of the UVB light spectrum which helps in re-pigmentation of the natural skin colour.</p>
      <p>Exposure time of narrowband UVB lamp is longer than traditional broadband UVB thereby yielding more effective and safe results.</p>
      <p>There are no risks and side effects of narrowband UVB light therapy as compared to the other treatment modalities e.g. systemic drugs.</p>
      <h3>NB-UVB therapeutic advantages for your skin condition</h3>
      <p>Narrowband UVB light therapy is very useful in the treatment of  <a href="vitiligo+treatment+in+delhi+vitiligo+surgery+in+delhi+dermatologist+in+delhi.html" title="vitiligo">vitiligo</a> and replacing traditional PUVA phototherapy treatment.</p>
      <h2 style="color:#01a1dd;"> Skin Grafting</h2>
      <p>With the help of UVB, the progression of disease can be stopped and sufficient pigmentation from live melanocytes is achieved but still some lesions fail to form colour even after prolonged phototherapy. In these conditions skin grafting is done. In this procedure, the skin from normal and hidden part of the body (Donor area) is taken and grafted over the vitiligo patch (Recipient area). It can be performed in many ways by the Skin surgeons. </p>
      <p><strong>The three main types are:</strong></p>
      <h3>Melanocyte Transplant (scar less transplant)</h3>
      <p><img src="https://www.drsandeshgupta.com/images/melanocyte-transplant.jpg"  style="border:0;" alt="" title="" class="imgleft"/></p>
      <p>Melanocyte transplantation is the latest surgical method for the treatment of stable vitiligo / leukoderma and loss of pigmentation. This treatment involves transferring of patients own melanocytes from an area of healthy skin (with pigment) to the vitiligo patch which has no melanocytes.</p>
      <p> This treatment has become a treatment of choice these days as it provides perfect pigmentation without leaving any scars. It is a highly specialized technique in which even the sensitive areas like eyelids, lips, fingers and joints can be treated without any scars with remarkable cosmetic results. Re-pigmentation is achieved within 1-3 months.</p>
      <h3>Punch Grafting</h3>
      <p><img src="https://www.drsandeshgupta.com/images/punch-grafting.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border:0;"  class="imgleft"/></p>
      <p>Punch Grafting is the treatment of choice in those vitiligo cases where lesions are located on legs, hands or involves bigger areas. This surgery is economical and very easy to perform. In this technique we take out very small punches of normal skin and place it over vitiligo skin by creating the small craters. After few days, these small skin grafts become fixed in vitiligo skin and these new skin grafts start producing pigment. It has a high success rate of 80 to 90 percent in most of the patients.</p>
      <div class="clearfix"></div>
      <h3>Blister Grafting</h3>
      <p>This technique is suitable for smaller vitiligo areas and the areas where very good cosmetic results are required egg. lips. In this type of grafting, few blisters are formed on normal skin with the help of suction pressure over the period of 2-3 hours, mainly from thighs. After this the roof of the formed blisters is removed and placed over abraded recipient vitiligo skin. Within few days this skin transfers melanocytes to the vitiligo skin and sheds off. After 2-3 months, the transferred melanocytes would re-pigment the vitiligo area.</p>

      <p><strong>Permanent:</strong> The hair growth is natural and permanent. We take hair follicles from back of scalp (occipital region) and these hairs usually don't shed as these are not affected by hormone which causes falling of hair.</p>
      <p><strong>Safe:</strong> It's a few hours’ surgery done under local anaesthesia. After transplant patient can do normal activities and can wash the head after 3 days.</p>
      <p><strong>Hair re- grow time:</strong> After transplant roots take 4 months to start growing and actual hair appear after 6 to 8 months, and then we can have desired growth.</p>
      <p><strong>No extra care:</strong> No extra care is required for growth of hair. You can wash, trim, tie hair in any manner. These are original hair.</p>

It can lead to considerable embarrassment and distress.</p>
      <p> The cause of melasma is complex. The pigmentation is due to overproduction of melanin by the pigment cells- melanocytes; which is taken up by the keratinocytes (epidermal melanosis) or deposited in the dermis (dermal melanosis, melanophages). There is a genetic predisposition to melasma. In most people melasma is a chronic disorder.</p>
      <p><strong>Known triggers for melasma include:</strong></p>
    <ul>
  <li><strong>Sun exposure and sun  damage</strong>- this is the most important avoidable risk factor</li>
  <li><strong>Pregnancy </strong>- in  affected women the pigment often fades a few months after delivery</li>
  <li><strong>Hormone treatments</strong>-  oral contraceptive pills containing oestrogen and/or progesterone, hormone  replacement, intrauterine devices and implants are a factor in about a quarter  of affected women</li>
  <li><strong>Certain medications,  scented or deodorant soaps, toiletries and cosmetics-</strong> these may cause a  phototoxic reaction that triggers melasma, which may then persist long term</li>
  <li><strong>Hypothyroidism -</strong>low  levels of circulating thyroid hormone</li>
  <li><strong>Exposure to ultraviolet  radiation (UVR)- </strong>it deepens the pigmentation because it activates the  melanocytes to produce more melanin.</li>
</ul>

      <p>Melasma is more common in women than in men. It generally starts between the age of 20 and 40 years.</p>
      <h2>Under eye dark circles</h2>

  <li><strong>Viora reaction-</strong> It is  very effective in Dark circle reduction by opening the lymphatic blockage and  increasing the blood supply of skin near the eyes and helps in skin tightening.</li>
  <li><strong>Chemical peels-</strong> various types of chemical peels are used according to skin conditions which  help in reducing the pigmentation and improving the skin texture.</li>
  <li><strong>Microdermabrasion- </strong>in  combination with other modalities microdermabrasion helps by abrading the skin,  increase vascularity of skin and thus helps in penetration of various medicines  inside the skin.</li>
  <li><strong>Conventional Medicines-</strong> as every melasma has its own reason, it’s very essential to diagnose it  properly and treat various inside factors and deficiencies with the help of  oral and topical medicines.</li>

As it is derived from the patient’s own blood, therefore has no potential for causing an immune reaction. With this we increase the amount of platelets at the site which releases various growth factors thereby recovers, repairs and augments hair health and growth.</p>
      <h3>How PRP is prepared?</h3>
      <p>In order to prepare PRP, blood is withdrawn and centrifuged by specialized machines/techniques so that concentrated platelets rich plasma is obtained which contains 5-8 times more platelets per cc as compared to normal plasma. This PRP can be injected directly on the scalp with very thin needle or can be applied with the help of derma roller.</p>

      <h3>Why tattoo removal?</h3>
      <p>In various surveys conducted worldwide, people give different reasons to remove tattoo i.e.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>They were too young at that time.</li>
  <li>Just don't want it as its marked for life.</li>
  <li>A name is written in a friendship which is no more.</li>
  <li>My parents got it on me.</li>
  <li>Unwanted for some jobs.</li>
</ul>
      <h3>Laser Tattoo Removal</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.drsandeshgupta.com/blog/tattoo-can-be-removed-by-q-switched-nd-yag-laser-in-3-4-sittings/" title="Tattoo Removal In Delhi">Tattoo removal</a> is done by lasers that can break down the ink particles in the tattoo. The broken-down ink is then absorbed by the body.</p>
      <p>A tattoo laser must be capable of emitting adequate energy within the given absorption spectrum of the pigment to provide an effective breakage of tattoo pigment. There are other colours in tattoo such as yelloww, green and fluorescent which are more challenging to treat over dark black and blue since they have absorption spectra that fall outside the emission spectra available in the tattoo removal laser. Recent pastel colour inks contain high concentrations of titanium dioxide which is highly reflective. Consequently, such inks are difficult to remove.</p>
      <h3>Mechanism of action</h3>
      <p>Generally, tattoos consist of thousands of particles of tattoo pigment suspended in the skin. Tattoo pigment particles are permanent because they are too big to be removed. Laser treatment causes tattoo pigment particles to heat up and fragment into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are then removed by normal body processes.</p>
      <p><strong>Laser tattoo removal </strong> is a successful application of the theory of selective photothermolysis (SPTL).</p>
      <p>However, unlike treatments for blood vessels or hair the mechanism required to shatter tattoo particles uses the photo mechanical effect. In this situation the energy is absorbed by the ink particles in a very short time, typically nanoseconds. The surface temperature of the ink particles can rise to thousands of degrees but this energy profile rapidly collapses into a shock wave. This shock wave then propagates throughout the local tissue (the dermis) causing brittle structures to fragment. Hence tissues are largely unaffected since they simply vibrate as the shock wave passes. For <strong>laser tattoo removal</strong> the selective destruction of tattoo pigments depends on four factors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The colour of the light must penetrate sufficiently deep into the skin to reach the tattoo pigment.</li>
        <li>The colour of the laser light must be more highly absorbed by the tattoo pigment than the surrounding skin, like red light is highly absorbed by green tattoo pigments.</li>
        <li>The time duration (pulse duration) of the laser energy must be very short, so that the tattoo pigment is heated to fragmentation temperature before its heat can dissipate to the surrounding skin. This duration should be in the order of nanoseconds.</li>
        <li>Sufficient energy must be delivered during each laser pulse to heat the pigment to fragmentation. If the energy is too low, pigment will not fragment and no removal will take place.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although they occur infrequently, mucosal tattoos can be successfully treated with  <strong>Q-switch lasers </strong> as well.</p>
      <p> Complete <strong>laser tattoo removal</strong> requires numerous treatment sessions, typically spaced at least four weeks apart. At each session, some but not all of the tattoo pigment particles are effectively fragmented, and the body removes the smallest fragments over the course of several weeks. The result is that the tattoo is lightened over time. Remaining large particles of tattoo pigment are then targeted at subsequent treatment sessions, causing further lightening. The number of sessions and spacing between treatments depends on various parameters, including the area of the body treated and skin colour.</p>
      <p>A predictive scale, the "Kirby-Desai Scale", was developed by Rd. Will Kirby and Rd. Alpesh Desai (<a href="dermatologist+in+delhi+best+dermatologist+in+delhi+skin+specialist+in+delhi.html" title="Dermatologists In Delhi">dermatologists</a> with specialization in tattoo removal techniques) is present to assess the potential success and number of treatments necessary for laser <strong>tattoo removal</strong>, Certain colours have proved more difficult to remove than others. For example, the molecular size of the green ink particles being significantly smaller than black colour.</p>
      <h3>R20 method </h3>
      <p>A new technique using two to four passes with the laser, twenty minutes apart, causes more breaking up of the ink than the conventional method.</p>
